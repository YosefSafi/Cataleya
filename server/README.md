# Cattleya Labs API

Express backend replacing the Base44 SDK calls in the frontend: auth (register/OTP/login/reset),
loyalty accounts, lab result (COA) storage, file uploads, newsletter signups, and order
checkout (Zelle + crypto via Coinbase Commerce).

## Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d        # starts local Postgres on :5432
npm install
npm run migrate             # creates tables
npm run dev                 # starts the API on :8080
```

By default `EMAIL_PROVIDER=console` and `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`, so OTP emails are logged to
the terminal and uploaded files are written to `server/uploads/` — no Azure resources needed to
develop locally.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                          | Auth | Notes |
|--------|-------------------------------|------|-------|
| POST   | /api/auth/register            | No   | Creates an unverified user, emails a 6-digit OTP |
| POST   | /api/auth/resend-otp           | No   | |
| POST   | /api/auth/verify-otp           | No   | Returns `{ access_token }` |
| POST   | /api/auth/login                | No   | Returns `{ access_token }` |
| GET    | /api/auth/me                   | Yes  | |
| POST   | /api/auth/forgot-password      | No   | Always returns 200 to avoid leaking which emails exist |
| POST   | /api/auth/reset-password       | No   | |
| GET    | /api/loyalty-accounts?user_id= | Yes  | User may only read/write their own account |
| POST   | /api/loyalty-accounts          | Yes  | |
| GET    | /api/lab-results?product_id=   | No   | Public, used to render COAs on product pages |
| POST   | /api/lab-results               | Admin only | For release 1, lab results are inserted directly into the `lab_results` table instead — this endpoint exists but isn't exercised by the UI flow |
| POST   | /api/upload                    | Yes  | multipart `file` field, returns `{ file_url }` |
| POST   | /api/newsletter/subscribe      | No   | Idempotent |
| GET    | /api/orders/payment-config     | No   | Returns the Zelle recipient info shown at checkout |
| POST   | /api/orders                    | No*  | Creates an order (guest checkout allowed). *Linked to the caller's account if a valid token is present |
| GET    | /api/orders/:id                | No   | Order id is an unguessable UUID, used as the confirmation/payment-instructions link |
| POST   | /api/orders/:id/crypto-checkout | No  | Creates a Coinbase Commerce charge (or a local stub in dev), returns `{ hosted_url }` |
| POST   | /api/orders/:id/simulate-paid  | No   | Dev-only — marks an order paid without a real payment. 404s unless `CRYPTO_PROVIDER` is unset/stub |
| POST   | /api/webhooks/coinbase         | No   | Coinbase Commerce webhook, marks orders paid on `charge:confirmed`. HMAC-verified against `COINBASE_COMMERCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |

### Checkout payment methods

**Zelle** has no merchant API — there's no way to verify a Zelle payment automatically. The
checkout flow shows the customer your Zelle email/name and the order's short ID as a memo, then
the order sits in `pending_payment` until you see the money land and mark it paid yourself:
`UPDATE orders SET status = 'paid' WHERE id = '...';`

**Crypto** goes through [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com/), which *does* confirm
automatically via webhook. Locally, with `CRYPTO_PROVIDER` unset (the default), checkout instead
redirects to a stub page at `/dev/crypto-stub/:id` in the frontend with a "Simulate Payment
Confirmed" button — this lets you exercise the entire order flow without a Coinbase account. To
go live: create a Coinbase Commerce account, set `CRYPTO_PROVIDER=coinbase`,
`COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY` (Settings → API keys), and `COINBASE_COMMERCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
(Settings → Webhook subscriptions — point it at `<your-api-url>/api/webhooks/coinbase`).

**Stripe (cards/Google Pay/Apple Pay) is deliberately not implemented** — Stripe's terms
prohibit many research-chemical businesses, and peptide vendors get declined or shut down
regularly. Revisit this in a later release if you set up an account with a processor that
explicitly allows the business.

Order prices are currently trusted from the client (the shop's product list lives in the
frontend, there's no backend product catalog yet) — fine for a first release with manually
confirmed payments, but worth hardening with a server-side price catalog before this scales.

Google OAuth login is implemented but **commented out** in `src/routes/auth.js` — deferred to a
second release. To re-enable: uncomment the `/google` and `/google/callback` routes (and the
`jwt` import above them), uncomment the "Continue with Google" button + handler in the
frontend's `Login.jsx`/`Register.jsx` and `redirectToGoogle()` in `apiClient.js`, restore the
`/auth/callback` route in `App.jsx`, and set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from
[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

To promote a user to admin (so they can use the lab-results upload UI, gated by `role`), update
the database directly: `UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = '...';`

## Deploying to Azure App Service

1. Provision an Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance and run `npm run migrate` against it
   (point `DATABASE_URL` at it).
2. Provision Azure Communication Services (email) and an Azure Storage account (blob
   container for lab result files), then set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=acs`, `STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure`,
   and the corresponding connection strings/keys as App Service Application Settings.
3. Set `JWT_SECRET` to a long random value, `CORS_ORIGIN` to your deployed frontend URL, and
   `FRONTEND_URL` (used in password reset email links).
4. Deploy this `server/` folder as the App Service's deployment root, with `npm install` and
   `npm start` as the build/run commands (Node 18+ Linux runtime).
