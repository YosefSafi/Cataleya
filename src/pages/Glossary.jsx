In BPC-157 research, attenuation of iNOS is investigated as part of potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms." },
  { term: "Intramuscular (IM) Injection", category: "Administration", definition: "Injection directly into muscle tissue, allowing faster absorption than subcutaneous injection. Used for some peptide protocols (HCG, certain GH protocols). Requires a longer needle and different injection technique than subcutaneous administration." },

  // L
  { term: "LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry)", category: "Analytical Chemistry", definition: "A highly sensitive analytical technique that combines chromatographic separation with mass spectrometric detection. Used for identity confirmation of peptides on COAs — can verify the exact molecular weight and fragmentation pattern of a compound, confirming its identity with high confidence." },
  { term: "Lyophilization (Freeze-Drying)", category: "Manufacturing", definition: "A preservation process that removes water from a product (in this case, a peptide solution) under frozen conditions using vacuum sublimation. Produces a stable dry powder (lyophilized cake) that is far more resistant to degradation than a liquid solution. Research peptides are supplied in lyophilized form for this reason." },

  // M

Ipamorelin demonstrates relative selectivity for GH secretion without significant prolactin elevation, which is considered a research advantage." },
  { term: "Proteolysis", category: "Biochemistry", definition: "The breakdown of proteins or peptides by proteolytic enzymes (proteases). Peptides administered orally are typically subject to extensive proteolysis in the gastrointestinal tract, which is the primary reason most research peptides have poor oral bioavailability and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly." },
  { term: "Purity (%)", category: "Quality Control", definition: "The percentage of the target compound relative to all substances detected in a sample, typically measured by HPLC. Research-grade peptides should typically be ≥98% pure, with premium suppliers targeting ≥99%. Lower purity means a higher proportion of unknown impurities, which complicates research interpretation." },

  // R
  { term: "Receptor Agonist", category: "Pharmacology", definition: "A compound that binds to a receptor and activates it, mimicking the effect of the natural ligand. Most research peptides are receptor agonists — for example, semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics and exceeds the activity of native GLP-1." },

Ipamorelin is noted for its high selectivity for the ghrelin receptor and relative lack of effect on cortisol and prolactin, compared to less selective GHRP compounds." },
  { term: "Stability", category: "Stability", definition: "The ability of a compound to maintain its chemical structure and biological activity over time under given conditions. Peptide stability depends on temperature, pH, light exposure, moisture, and mechanical stress. Lyophilized peptides are generally far more stable than reconstituted solutions." },
  { term: "Subcutaneous (SubQ) Injection", category: "Administration", definition: "Injection into the subcutaneous tissue layer beneath the skin and above the muscle. The most common route for research peptide administration. Provides slower, more sustained absorption than intramuscular injection. Typically performed using short, fine-gauge insulin needles (29–31G) at a 45° or 90° angle." },
  { term: "Synergy", category: "Pharmacology", definition: "When two compounds used together produce an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects. The CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin combination is studied for potential synergy in GH release because they act on complementary receptors (GHRH-R and GHS-R) in the same GH secretion pathway." },

  // V
  { term: "VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)", category: "Biology", definition: "A signal protein that stimulates the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis). Elevated VEGF expression is investigated as a biomarker of angiogenic activity in TB-500/thymosin beta-4 preclinical studies, particularly in cardiac and wound healing models." },
